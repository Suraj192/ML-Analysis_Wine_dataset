Description

Our data is downloaded from the above source given. The source consists of originally two different wine datasets (i.e. White-Wine and Red-Wine). Machine learning models was done only with the White-Wine dataset.

Our primary objective of this task is to use machine learning models by understanding the data. Furthermore, our task involves appropriate selection of model's features, balancing data and to find the appropriate predictive scores for the data. The Overall task is divided into 4 parts Regression analysis, Classification-Supervised analysis, Semi-supervised models and Clustering models which is aggregated with 3 different files.
